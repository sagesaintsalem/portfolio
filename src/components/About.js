            <h1>Hi, I'm Rita!</h1>
            <p>I am a junior full-stack developer with a keen interest in UI design and a background in volunteering
                and academia. I consider myself to be both an analytical and a creative person and I find that software
                development is a great way to merge those two aspects of my personality.

                I recently completed CodeClan's 16-week Full Stack Software Development bootcamp, where I built 3 apps from scratch
                in the following languages and frameworks - 

                <ul>
                    <li>Python with Flask</li>
                    <li>Javascript with Express and React</li>
                    <li>Java with Spring</li>
                </ul>

                This site showcases the best of my work so far.
